<font size="4"> <i> Fyodor Dostoevsky</i>, the renowed Russian author, became a phenomenon in the world <br>
of literature during the mid-19th century. His writing style that is greatly rich with <br> psychological depth, philosophical themes, and vivid potrayals of human emotions has <br> regarded him as one of the greatest novelist in history. 
 
<br><br>
While reading one of his greatest work, <i>Crime and Punishment</i>, my first thought was <br>
that the novel is going to discuss about the crime and the punishment equally. Since <br>
the book was divided into 6 parts, I thought the first half of the book is about the crime <br>
and the second half is about the punishment. But after finishing the novel I realised <br>
the <i>punishment</i> in the novel is not the punishment that I was expecting at all.

<br><br>
Dostoevsky explores the effects of guilt and the psychological torment it inflicts on <br>
the main character, Raskolnikov. He delves into Raskolnikov's inner turmoil, <br>
his conflicting beliefs, and his descent into madness. Dostoevsky's portrayal of guilt <br>
is haunting, capturing the psychological weight and torment that Raskolnikov experiences <br>
as he confronts his own conscience and seeks redemption.

<br><br>
<i>Crime and Punishment</i> was the first Dostoevsky's novel that I read and soon after <br>
I finished it I quickly understood why Dostoevsky was such a phenomenon author. <br>
His view in human psychology and morality is very fascinating and the way he potrays <br>
it in his writing creates a powerful impact to the readers.

<br><br>
Dostoevsky is one of my favorite author and I wish to read more of his works.
